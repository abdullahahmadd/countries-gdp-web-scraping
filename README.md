# 🌍 GDP Web Scraping & Data Analysis Project

This project extracts, cleans, and analyzes global nominal GDP data from an archived Wikipedia source using Python. The workflow demonstrates practical skills in web scraping, data transformation, and analytical processing using Pandas, NumPy, and BeautifulSoup.

## 📌 Overview

The project focuses on:

- Scraping GDP data from an HTML table  
- Converting raw data into a structured DataFrame  
- Cleaning and transforming GDP values  
- Identifying the top 10 largest economies  
- Adding analytical fields such as GDP Share (%), Ranking, and Normalized Score  
- Exporting the processed dataset for further use  

This provides a clear understanding of global economic distribution based on nominal GDP.
